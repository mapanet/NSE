# 4.0 NSE calculation fro Boundaries layer = 6 (Neighborhoods)

## Purpose in the NSE Pipeline

This dataset is used to:

- Build **Boundaries Layer 6** (Neighborhoods)  
- Perform **spatial intersection** with AGEB polygons  
- Calculate **area‑weighted NSE** values per neighborhood  

---

## Why Area Weighting Is Required

Neighborhoods often cross multiple AGEB boundaries.  
Each AGEB has its own AMAI NSE classification, so the neighborhood inherits a **weighted NSE** based on the proportion of its area that falls within each AGEB.

### Example

| AGEB | % Area in Neighborhood | C+ | C | D+ | E |
|------|------------------------|----|---|----|---|
| A | 70 % | 40 | 30 | 20 | 10 |
| B | 30 % | 10 | 20 | 40 | 30 |

The neighborhood’s weighted values are:

C+ = 0.7 × 40 + 0.3 × 10
C  = 0.7 × 30 + 0.3 × 20

This ensures that the NSE assigned to each neighborhood accurately reflects the socioeconomic composition of the AGEBs it overlaps.
